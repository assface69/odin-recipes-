# odin-recipes-
This basically is a project where i have to use html i've learnt so far in odin project.
After this project it'd be concluded that i know the basics of html, basic use of the command line tool and a bit about the use of git and github. Arigato :) .

Now im done withh the project, only adding two recipes namely; toast bread and Casserole. I'm pretty lazy but this was fun to do and i'm excited for more projects.
